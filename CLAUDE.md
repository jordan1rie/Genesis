# Creative Strategy Workspace

> **New here?** Your onboarding home is the Exodus dashboard (Settings → Claude Code) — it walks you through install and keys. If anything's broken at runtime, run `npx @aicopycoders/exodus doctor` from this directory — it diagnoses local and dashboard-side issues in one shot.

This is a creative-strategy workspace operated by the **exodus** CLI. It is brand-agnostic infrastructure serving **all of the account's brands**: each brand has its own subfolder here (marked by a `.exodus-brand.json` file) holding that brand's `state/` and `output/`. Which brand you're working on resolves **folder first, pointer second**: commands run from inside a brand's subfolder target that brand automatically; otherwise the `npx @aicopycoders/exodus brand use <slug>` pointer applies. (Older single-brand installs keep `state/` and `output/` at this root — same rules, one brand.)

**How to engage the system:** every skill here is namespaced `exodus-*`, and a front-door `exodus` hub skill routes generic asks. Members say "exodus" to engage ("exodus, write me some ads") or invoke a specific skill with `/exodus-<name>` (e.g. `/exodus-write`). This namespacing is deliberate: it lets these skills coexist with other skill packs (like the workshop pack) installed in the same folder, and it keeps the bare word "Genesis" unambiguous — on its own, "Genesis" always means the member's own Genesis API key/recipes, never Exodus. CLI commands are unchanged (`npx @aicopycoders/exodus genesis`, `npx @aicopycoders/exodus brand use`, etc.).

The strategist persona, the Luke Mills / Genesis frameworks, the operating rules and creative principles, and the operating discipline all live in **one skill** plus its references:

- `.claude/skills/exodus-strategist/SKILL.md` — the single always-on creative-strategy skill: persona, operating rules, creative principles, red flags, active-brand resolution, the quality bars, and a **Framework Index** that routes to the depth below
- `references/` — the framework depth, consulted from the skill when needed: `creative-strategy.md` (the encyclopedia + Genesis bot catalog), `segments.md`, `copy-blocks.md` (P3C2), `cast-video.md` (CAST), `iterations.md` (CASHED), `editing-rules.md`, `scrawls.md`, `hook-quality-checklist.md`, `awareness-framework.md`

If the persona isn't firing for you, check that the skill loaded. It is not optional reading.

## Two systems in this folder: Exodus (automatic) + Genesis (manual)

This folder usually holds **two related products that share the same Genesis engine** — keep them straight. Think of it as a car: same engine underneath, two ways to drive it.

- **Exodus — the automatic transmission.** This workspace: the `exodus-*` skills and the `npx @aicopycoders/exodus` CLI. Pre-built, done-for-you pipelines (write, image, idea bank, brand onboarding) that drive the Genesis bots *for* you against your brand. You engage it by saying **"exodus"** ("exodus, write me some ads"). Its keys are `EXODUS_API_KEY` / `EXODUS_API_URL` in `.env`; Genesis access is internal — there's nothing to configure or debug about Genesis for Exodus to work.

- **Genesis (standalone) — the manual transmission.** A separate skill at `.claude/skills/genesis-bots` that calls the *same* Genesis copywriting / research / strategy bots **directly** with the member's own `gen_` key — you pick a bot and prompt it yourself. It reads `GENESIS_API_KEY` plus a provider key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) from `.env`. This is the member's own workflow, **not** owned by the `exodus-*` skills. (It may not be installed in every folder — check for the `genesis-bots` skill.)

**Routing rule:** "exodus …" → the Exodus pipelines below. Bare **"genesis"**, "run the bots", or a named bot slug → the `genesis-bots` skill (the member's direct workflow — never route it into Exodus). If someone clearly just wants ads and doesn't know which system they have, ask one question — "drive the Genesis bots directly, or run an Exodus pipeline?" — rather than guessing.

**Provider key:** the manual Genesis bots need a provider key in `.env`. `npx @aicopycoders/exodus keys pull` syncs your dashboard provider + image keys down for you (the install runs it; safe to re-run anytime keys change). Exodus's own pipelines don't need it locally — they run server-side.

## Multi-Brand Operating Notes

Any user can create and own unlimited brands — `npx @aicopycoders/exodus brand create "<name>"` (or the dashboard); it is NOT admin-only, and brand names are scoped per user (two users can each have an "Evergreen Fitness"). One account key then switches across every brand the user owns (admins: every brand). The only exception is a brand someone ELSE invited the user into — they don't own it, so their key stays pinned to just that one. Never tell a user they can't make brands or are "locked to one brand" just because their key shows `role: member`. The active brand resolves **folder > pointer > key default**: being inside a brand's subfolder wins, then the `brand use` pointer, then the key's default brand.

- **Identify the active brand:** `npx @aicopycoders/exodus brand current` (also says whether it came from the folder or the pointer)
- **List accessible brands:** `npx @aicopycoders/exodus brand list`
- **Create a new brand:** `npx @aicopycoders/exodus brand create "<name>"` — creates it server-side, switches you in, and sets up its local subfolder
- **Switch brand:** `npx @aicopycoders/exodus brand use <slug>` — or just work from inside that brand's subfolder
- **New brand created on the dashboard?** `npx @aicopycoders/exodus@latest init` creates its subfolder and pulls its profile
- **Update the CLI + skills:** `npx @aicopycoders/exodus@latest update` — the only command that refreshes `.claude/skills/` and the workspace docs (`doctor` reports health but never rewrites them)
- **Brand voice / ICP / offer:** the active brand's `state/brand-profile.md` (inside its subfolder; at this root on older single-brand installs) — read this at session start and after any switch. If it doesn't match the active brand, the exodus-strategist skill will prompt to refresh.

Don't carry voice or proven angles across brands — each brand is its own creative universe.

## Available Pipelines

### Exodus pipelines (automatic)

These are the **Exodus** pipelines — the automatic system that drives the Genesis bots for you. Use them to generate and analyze creative. Each has its own skill directory in `.claude/skills/`. Invoke them by saying "exodus" plus what you want, or directly with `/exodus-<name>`.

| Pipeline | Skill | When to Use |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Write** | `exodus-write` | **Start here for copywriting.** Say what you want ("exodus, write me some ads"); it routes new-brand → foundation → brief → genesis → Doc and sequences the whole flow. |
| **Genesis** | `exodus-genesis` | Brief → ad copy in two voices (Mario + Infeed). Default 1 pass = 2 variants; scale with `--passes` (pass 2 adds the Top-Ads-biased primer). |
| **Image** | `exodus-image` | **Start here for static images.** Say what you want; it reads the request and routes to the right engine — `exodus-creative` (renders from copy) or `exodus-template` (50 ad-type formats). |
| **Creative** | `exodus-creative` | A specific creative-suite engine (native / copy-derived renders from copy, or ref-match to a reference image) when you've already picked one. Otherwise start at **Image**. |
| **Template** | `exodus-template` | Finished ad copy → many static ads across 50 structured formats (testimonial, hero, UGC…). Otherwise start at **Image**. |
| **Meme** | `exodus-meme` | Meme ads — recommends formats for a brief, then one batched run renders AI-image and classic Imgflip-template memes server-side. |
| **Workflow** | `exodus-workflow` | Run and build saved multi-node workflow automations from the CLI, resolve checkpoint/repair parks from the inbox, continue bot sessions, fire triggers, and read banks or promote winners. |
| **Hooks** | `exodus-hooks` | Read the Scout library — the hook cards captured from Instagram outliers. Compose filters (score, lane, validation status, language, hook type, recency), inspect one card, find cards sharing a hook pattern, export to CSV. Read-only. |
| **Browse** | `exodus-browse` | View history and retrieve past outputs |
| **Drive** | `exodus-drive` | Read/write Google Docs, Sheets, and Drive files via `npx @aicopycoders/exodus drive` (uses the dashboard's Google OAuth — no local CLI) |
| **Winners** | `exodus-winners` | Mine your own Meta ad account for winning ads (via the Meta Ads MCP) and import them into Exodus as generative fuel — interview, visual confirmation, `npx @aicopycoders/exodus winners import` |

For the operator-facing quick reference on how to invoke these in Claude Code, see `PIPELINES.md` in the workspace root.

### Genesis bots (manual)

The same folder usually also carries **`genesis-bots`** — the *manual* way to drive the same Genesis bots. You pick a bot and prompt it yourself with the member's own `gen_` key, chaining bots by hand (buyer profile → creative brief → ad hooks → ads). It is **not** an `exodus-*` skill and is **never** invoked by saying "exodus".

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `genesis-bots` | The user says bare **"genesis"**, "run the bots", "openclaw", or names a bot slug, and wants to call a Genesis copywriting / research / strategy / image-prompt bot directly. Needs `GENESIS_API_KEY` plus a provider key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) in `.env` — see **Dashboard** below. May not be installed in every folder — check for the skill directory before assuming it's there. |

Route a bare-"genesis" ask to this skill and an "exodus …" ask to the pipelines above — never cross the two. If someone clearly just wants ads and doesn't know which system they have, ask one question ("drive the Genesis bots directly, or run an Exodus pipeline?") rather than guessing.

## Awareness Level Routing

Every ad targets an audience at a specific awareness level. Getting this right is one of the highest-leverage decisions in creative strategy.

> `--awareness` sets the audience awareness level for a Genesis run (unaware / problem-aware / solution-aware / product-aware). Pick the level the idea is actually written for.

| Level | Audience State | Ad Approach |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Unaware** | Doesn't know they have a problem | Shock, pattern interrupt, reveal |
| **Problem-Aware** | Knows the problem, not the solution | Educate, validate, agitate |
| **Solution-Aware** | Knows solutions exist, not ours | Compare, differentiate, position |
| **Product-Aware** | Knows the brand, hasn't bought yet | Offer, urgency, social proof |

Routing detail and signal patterns live in `.claude/skills/exodus-strategist/SKILL.md` and `references/creative-strategy.md`.

## Dashboard

This workspace connects to a live dashboard for:
- Settings management (defaults, account connections)
- **Pipeline keys** — your provider LLM key (Anthropic or OpenRouter) plus Kie.ai, entered once in Settings → Pipeline Keys
- Google Drive credentials (where outputs are saved)
- Run history and output retrieval
- Ad account connections (e.g. the Genesis top-ads-biased track)
- Brand admin (switching, profile management)

The dashboard URL and your `EXODUS_API_KEY` live in `.env`.

**Keys & setup.** Exodus's own pipelines run server-side and need nothing beyond `EXODUS_API_KEY` — there's no provider key to configure for them. The **manual `genesis-bots` path** (and other local tools) *do* need a provider key in `.env`. Enter your keys once in the dashboard, then pull them down:

- `npx @aicopycoders/exodus keys pull` — writes your dashboard provider + Kie.ai keys into `.env` (the install runs this for you; safe to re-run anytime a key changes). It only upserts the keys and preserves the rest of the file.
- `npx @aicopycoders/exodus keys status` — shows which keys are set in the dashboard vs locally. Values are never printed.

---

## Reviewing Run Output

When you need to review a run's creative output, always read it via `npx @aicopycoders/exodus read-doc <runId>`. This walks every tab of the Google Doc and gives you the full output as markdown.

Do **not** use the Drive MCP as your first choice — it only sees tab 1 and will misreport the run as empty. If `npx @aicopycoders/exodus read-doc` exits with code 2 (`unavailable`), fall back to the Drive MCP using the URL printed by the command, and warn the user in your summary that you only saw tab 1.

---

## Tool Feedback

This workspace is also a testbed for the CLI and pipelines. When you run a pipeline and hit a gap — a missing input, missing output, missing filter, awkward flow — log it per the **Tool Feedback Protocol** in `.claude/skills/exodus-strategist/SKILL.md`. Your feedback drives the next round of pipeline improvements.
